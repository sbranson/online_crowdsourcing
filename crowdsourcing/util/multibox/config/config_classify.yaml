# Image Processing and Augmentation 
# There are 5 steps to image processing:
# 1) Extract regions from the image
# 2) Extract a crops from each region
# 3) Resize the crops for the network architecture
# 4) Flip the crops
# 5) Modify the colors of the crops
IMAGE_PROCESSING : {
    # All images will be resized to the [INPUT_SIZE, INPUT_SIZE, 3]
    INPUT_SIZE : 299,

    # 1) First we extract regions from the image
    # What type of region should be extracted, either 'image' or 'bbox'
    REGION_TYPE : 'image',

    # Specific whole image region extraction configuration
    WHOLE_IMAGE_CFG : {},

    # Specific bounding box region extraction configuration
    BBOX_CFG : {
        # We can centrally expand a bbox (i.e. turn a tight crop into a loose crop)

            WIDTH_EXPANSION_FACTOR : 2.0, # Expand the width by a factor of 2 (centrally)
            HEIGHT_EXPANSION_FACTOR : 2.0, # Expand the height by a factor of 2 (centrally)
        }
    },

    # 2) Then we take a random crop from the region
    # The fraction of time to take a random crop, 0 is never, 1 is always
    DO_RANDOM_CROP : 0,
    RANDOM_CROP_CFG : {
        MIN_AREA : 0.5, # between 0 and 1, how much of the region must be included

        MIN_ASPECT_RATIO : 0.7, # minimum aspect ratio of the crop
        MAX_ASPECT_RATIO : 1.33, # maximum aspect ratio of the crop
        MAX_ATTEMPTS : 100, # maximum number of attempts before returning the whole region
    },

    # Alternatively we can take a central crop from the image
    DO_CENTRAL_CROP : 0, # Fraction of the time to take a central crop, 0 is never, 1 is always
    CENTRAL_CROP_FRACTION : 0.875, # Between 0 and 1, fraction of size to crop

    # 3) We need to resize the extracted regions to feed into the network. 
    MAINTAIN_ASPECT_RATIO : false,
    # Avoid slower resize operations (bi-cubic, etc.)
    RESIZE_FAST : true,

    # 4) We can flip the regions
    # Randomly flip the image left right, 50% chance of flipping
    DO_RANDOM_FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT : false,

    # 5) We can distort the colors of the regions
    # The fraction of time to distort the color, 0 is never, 1 is always
    DO_COLOR_DISTORTION : 0, 
    # Avoids slower ops (random_hue and random_contrast)
    COLOR_DISTORT_FAST : false
